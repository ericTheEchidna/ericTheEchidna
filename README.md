- 👋 Hi, I’m @ericTheEchidna
-   I'm a retired Java developer having just left UC Berkeley in mid-2022.
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
-   Retro computing, but since I'm old it feels quite modern.
-   My first computer was a Sinclair ZX81.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
-   Brushing off my C/C++ skils and doing my take on the classic main-frame game Trek, or Super Trek, or whatever. I used to play on the thermal paper teletype that my dad got to take home from Lawrence Berkeley Nat'l Lab occasionally.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn more about: 
-   AI image recognition.
-   TTL/CMOS electronics.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
-   here?
